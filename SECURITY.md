## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Use one of the following private reporting channels:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (preferred, if enabled)
    - Go to the repository **Security** tab → **Advisories** → **New draft security advisory**.
2. **Email**
    - Send details to: chainsmith@57blocks.com

When reporting, please include:

- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if available)
- Affected versions and environments
- Any relevant logs, stack traces, or screenshots (redact secrets)

## What to Expect

- We aim to acknowledge receipt within **2 business days**.
- We will work with you to validate the report and determine severity.
- If a fix is required, we will coordinate a responsible disclosure timeline.

Thank you for helping keep ChainSmith and its users safe.
